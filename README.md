## Files on this repo
The file "SQL Code for Instacart.ipynb" includes the SQL code that was used to format the tables in the correct way.

The file "Using Sample of Data to Test Features.ipynb" takes the tables created in the previous file and tests adding various features to the model. By the end of the file, all of the features have been selected and created.

The file "Tuning the Model with Sample Data.ipynb" includes code that was used to adjust the parameters of the final model in order to get the best predictions. Both this file and the previous file use a subset of the total data.

The file "Creating df_X with All Data.ipynb" creates all of the features on the entire dataset.

The file "Running Model on All Data.ipynb" runs the model on the entire dataset with the parameters found previously.
